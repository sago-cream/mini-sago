A Discord bot for... everything?
Codex-powered chat with server context, emote creation and cross-server migration, manage issue or publish PR based on discussion context, maintain PR review thread life cycle, set reminders, process images, access files from my Mac, you name it.

## Features

- Reacts to community messages with emotes in configured server.
- Answers member and configured role mentions using conversation context, attachments, public web search, and accessible Discord history.
- Joins Discord voice channels for spoken conversations. **WIP and far from usable:** recognition, response latency, and turn-taking still need work.
- Performs expression management on demand, including adding emojis or stickers from attachments and moving emojis to other servers.
- Publishes daily TOEFL vocabulary, AniGamer forum voucher code updates, Threads keyword matches, and Codex news on X to configured channels.
- Improves Instagram and Twitter/X embeds with `kkinstagram.com` and `fxtwitter.com` links.
- Creates reminders when asked to and pings you when the reminder expires.
- Listen to GitHub activities and maintains PR review threads for certain repo in configured server.
- Find files in my Mac and send it in chat when asked by me.
- Runs coding tasks in dedicated Discord threads with progress reports,
  steering, stop, and continuation, then publishes a draft PR when authorized.

> [!TIP]
> Mention MiniSago under **Members/Apps**, or use a configured MiniSago role.
> When quoting her messages, disable reply ping to prevent triggering another reply.
> She searches only channels the requester can access, so feel free to continue to talk behind someone's back.
